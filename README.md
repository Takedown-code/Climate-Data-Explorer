# 🌍 Climate Data Explorer

An interactive front-end web application that allows users to explore climate change metrics over different decades. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js, the site provides a clean and responsive interface where users can dynamically view trends in global **temperature**, **sea level**, and **CO₂ levels**.

## 👥 User Stories

> These represent potential use cases and motivations for users.

- *As a student*, I want to explore how temperature and CO₂ levels have changed over time so I can use real visuals in my school presentation.
- *As a teacher*, I want to show my class interactive graphs of climate trends to increase engagement and awareness.
- *As a data enthusiast*, I want to switch between metrics easily and understand correlations between them over time.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Website

- **Educate** users about the importance of climate trends through intuitive visuals.
- **Empower** users to engage with data directly in an interactive way.
- **Inspire** curiosity and further exploration of real-world environmental datasets.

## 🧩 Wireframes

During the design phase of this project, wireframes were created to help visualize the layout and ensure a clear, user-focused structure.

### Desktop Layout

> This wireframe was used to plan the arrangement of the header, dropdown controls, chart container, and footer. It helped guide the development of a clean and responsive layout.

## 🧪 Testing Documentation

**Browsers tested:**
- Chrome ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Microsoft Edge ✅
- Safari ✅

**Test Cases:**
- Selecting different metrics and year ranges updates the chart as expected
- Layout adjusts cleanly on screens below 600px
- Chart renders correctly on page load
- Dropdowns are accessible via keyboard and mouse
- Page loads in under 1 second (measured locally)

> Automated testing not included in this version — manual functional testing only.
